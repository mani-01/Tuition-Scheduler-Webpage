## Project Brief & Requirements

The goal of this project was to create a [CRUD](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud) application using a variety of tools, methodologies, and technologies that were covered during training.

Below is a set of high-level requirements to be fulfilled for the successful completion of this project:

- Complete a **Jira** board with user stories, use cases and tasks.
- Write documentation describing the architecture used.
- Create a detailed Risk Assessment for the project.
- Create a **SQL** relational database used to store data persistently for the project.
- Create an application in **Java** that meets the requirements set on the Kanban Board.
- Using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**, create a functioning front-end website and integrate API.
- Design automated tests for validation of the application using **JUnit** and **Mockito** for unit testing, and **Selenium** for integration testing.
- Build code thorough **CI Server**.
- Deploy the app to a **GCP virtual machine**.
- Integrate the code fully into the version control system, **Git**.
  
## The App Idea

A tuition scheduler web app which allows the user to **create, read, update, and delete** student, course, and lesson entries, while also letting the user to export a receipt of money owed per student at the end of the month.

### User Flow Diagram
As part of the initial planning stage, a flow chart was created to outline the basic app idea. It maps the steps the user can take from page to page.
